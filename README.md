Abstract - 
Twitter bot is a program used to produce automated posts, follow Twitter users or serve as spam to entice clicks on the Twitter microblogging service. 
In this project, we will use Machine Learning techniques to predict weather an account on Twitter is a Bot or a real user performing significant 
amount of feature engineering, along with feature extraction considering around 20 features like name of the twitter account, description, profile image, 
inactivity, twitter posts etc. We are implementing our own custom algorithm in order to achive high accuracy.
